the frequency of dark - coloured moths increased at that time , an example of industrial melanism .

naturally , the larger the heatsink ( and the more aluminium it has in it ) , the longer it will take to heat .
even if one were to obtain an infinitely large block of aluminium , if a bracket or other mounting arrangement directly underneath the heat source ( the transistors ) is not thick enough , it will have significant thermal resistance , and the transistors may just overheat anyway , so we do need to look at all the resistances in the thermal circuit , not just the heatsink itself .
for the same mass , aluminium is a much better choice than copper - assuming of course that you were planning a copper heatsink .
for a given weight of material , aluminium requires over twice as much heat input as copper to raise its temperature by 1k ( 1 ° c ) .
this means that an aluminium heatsink will absorb more energy for the same temperature rise , providing a useful thermal buffer .
i have a steady income , so if i could get help paying all of these large expenses off and then break up the loan into 4 reasonable instalments i 'd be so grateful .

that is n't a value judgement , it 's just how the word works .
how will disney+ affect disney ’s movie theatre attendance rates , idk , will people start to just wait til it ’s on their streaming service since they ’re paying for it .
will they just stop paying for it if they go to see their movies in the theatre , idk personally .
the supreme court just ruled that studios can own their own theatres giving netflix the ability to own its own theatres and removing theatres , and award ceremonies leverage of having a specified exclusivity time limit in theatre before it goes elsewhere .
disney is confusing in its streaming already breaking its content into 3 services , their gon na eventually have to increase their prices and will people continue to see it as attractive as it is currently with them still having to go see their movies in theatres since they will continues their exclusivity with theatres .
this idea is far more important than memorising a meaningless set of moves .
it ’s analogous to hive ( not that i ’m any good at hive ) ; you could memorise a sequence of placings of tiles that will generally give you an advantage against an unprepared player , but you wo n’t be able to convert that into a win unless you actually understand what you ’re doing .
but that will not be due to any opening knowledge on the part of the opponent , because a beginner is unlikely to play any kind of recognised opening .
instead , it will be due to the more experienced player making generally good moves ; developing their pieces into better positions , and capitalising on the blunders their opponent makes .
sure , there are geniuses who play chess , who memorise a large number of opening lines , but they will also understand the reason why they are making those moves .
as soon as someone makes a move that is not in the main line , they have to know why it is a bad move in order to capitalise on that , which is why it requires understanding .

lets analyse my statement and your rebuttal .
there are occasional glimpses of all the other colours .
i can see a sultai or temur three - colour .
reading between the lines in your other answers i do get the sense you value knowledge in a blue way and that is what would bring you fulfilment , self - acceptance , and maximum happiness .
it 's stereotypically blue , and blue and green can be very inward colours combined , but i 'm hesitant to put much weight on it .
any colour can be wilful .
green / red actually was n't sure how to colour this one , it 's more about what you left out i think , but it does contribute to my impression that you 're a reserved person with a private inner world , which makes me lean towards the ug part of temur .
you might have to colour this one yourself . :)
their presence made me suspect i was missing some element of your personality in these short answers , maybe misunderstanding your ambition ( if i 'm de - emphasising this element , i 'd say you 're probably sultai instead of temur ) .
a repeated theme when i interpret you as temur is that you kind of reject the w vs. b way of looking at the world , of very strong opinions and conflicts and individual vs. community ethics ( or lack thereof ) , in favour of just getting on with those around you as best as you can and prioritising interpersonal and communal values and the actualisation of yourself and those around you .
i really feel like you 're very simic ( remember , the simic combine is just one representation of ug ) for two colours .
what colours go with x ? -
also just noticed ... it 's trying to read from my old wd disc not my ssd which windows is installed .
either get some couples counselling or time to move on .
i think i 'm a ( borderline ) snowplough parent .
i also think there are some unique components in my system , for example making goals of the emotions , like fulfilment , satisfaction and so on , that you want in your life and then choosing your real - world goals according to their ability to deliver those emotions .
so yes , there 's definitely elements of cbt and rebt in it , but i do n't think that 's because i 'm just rehashing them , it 's because those are great tools in trying to achieve anything so it 's sensible to include elements of them in a system that is trying to help people maximise their happiness .

meanwhile , the then - leader of islington council ( 1982 - 92 ) , whose decision to permit the destruction of the cemetery was eventually overturned , was none other than margaret hodge ( though it is unclear whether she personally was in favour of the proposal).i have deliberately omitted from this discussion any consideration of corbyn ’s attitude to zionism and whether anti - zionism is inherently anti - semitic .

then after sam lufti drugged britney then called cops on her claiming she was wreckless driving doing illegal things and suicidal he then tried to turn family against britney in mix of that they were already trying to get conservatorship but it was big mess .. all i can say is family is convinced that this was only way to take control back of britney life they also think only way protect her from sam lufti it 's interesting dialogue between forces of protection and control that the family thinks they gain from this .

and i do seem to remember matt saying he 'd very much like to avoid going into super high levels this time around ( so caleb 's research into time magic could be done in an epilogue or something ) , and if we then are in essentially the end - game or lead - up to the end - game ( it 'd feel really tacked on if there 's another tharizdun cell with immeasurable power out there , or some other big villain like idk tiamat suddenly reared their head ) , then i 'd like the stakes and enemy abilities to reflect that .

the goal is to bring these communities along for the ride instead of exiling them to the fringe of the city because they ca n’t keep up with the rapid economic and cultural changes that certain developments can bring to certain neighbourhoods .

not who you asked but anyway , you ’re probably more prepared to write a screenplay ( once you learn the correct formatting ) than a novel , but if you ’re set on a novel , you can definitely learn to write dialogue by reading for enjoyment and practise , maybe you could ask a friend or family member if the dialogue seems natural .
anyway , i do n’t think writing screenplay dialogue in a novel would be generally appreciated by most audiences , but many people like reading plays , whether they actually get performed or not .
that means everyone able needs to be talking to their family , friends and coworkers about labour 's policies , and motivating them to get out and vote ! .

we lost our offensive touch and minus a few games of high scoring we just look confused and if that was sacrificed for defence fine , but it ’s not and our defence looks worse than it ’s ever been .

edit : reading though the thread more its starting to become a lot more grey , it seems op had a history of trying to defend his grandfather 's actions and denying the war crimes which most likely occurred .
but that does n't mean that no one suffers from it and we have to recognise a culture ( even here on the dd , daily ) of defensive overreactions against opinions unfavourable to bodybuildings and bodybuilders .
but realise that they are plenty of other values we can rely upon , plenty of other opportunities to realise what we sometimes think muscularity can bring .
we must take some time and honesty to realise this .
but it can also bring suffering and when that happens , it 's important to realise that this culture is not the ultimate truth and there are other ways of being happy and feeling adequate .

i ’m no expert either , i just kind of kept layering colours until i got the one i was looking for , i found it to be pretty forgiving !

in order to convey that info , our brain - perception - centre creates the perception of a colour that 's not associated with any wavelength . (
technically , it 's always creating the perception of a colour , even when it does have a wavelength ) .
an animal with x cones has x-2 intermediate cones that can be ' skipped ' , so assuming their brain processes all of those , they can perceive 2(x-2 ) the amount of colour states , assuming that their upper and lower bound are the same as ours .
so all of a sudden , looking at an animal with 5 cones , same bounds as us , we have 1/4th to 1/8th the colour space as they do .
so very quickly , they have enormously more colour space than we do and the visual comparison does n't really help .
the comparative problem is : what 's a colour ?
it 's pretty hard to define hue already , and our normal hue scale already does n't include some colours we can see , like cyan .
we only have one cone that can be skipped , and already it makes our colour space not only difficult to measure , but difficult to define .
do we just assume that every possible combination of activated / not activated cones is the basis for a vector in the colour space ?
so how do you arrive at a good comparison of different colour spaces ?
terrain , food , friend , mate , fight , run , ... " , an animal does n't exactly need a lot of different colours as long as they 're all distinct .
advanced photoreceptors are usually partially a result of things being similar colours and needing to tell them apart .

treat it like a regular external power mosfet installation ( there are plenty of guides online ) , but instead use two external mosfets , two beds , two dedicated power / ground wire pairs from the psu , and then from the original heated bed terminals on the board , you can run two pairs of smaller gauge wire to act as signal wires to tell the external mosfets to turn on / off as the firmware requests it to maintain temp .

i do n't know anything about how video games are programmed , but it seems unlikely to me that they would just come up with dialogue as they wrote the code for the game , on the fly , no pre - planning .
i suppose whoever was coding the dialogue could be that person , and they wrote out all the dialogue in this form .
they surely had their dialogue written out nicely for recording .
the dialogue is very easy to get through in spite of quantity .
even if it were all jammed into one giant .txt file , a simple find of three or four words of a dialogue jets me right to it .
some were poor judgement and many were highly unethical .

try reading your dialogue aloud to see if it sounds natural . /
again , in dialogue , consider reading aloud to see if it has the right mouth feel .

initially the concept was never going to find favour but the outbreak of war did renew interest from the ministry although they were very sceptical .
after a series of stops and starts and endless ministry interference the project was actually cancelled in june of 1940 and de havilland told to concentrate on its war work .
however , the dh 998 concept had won over some air staff one or two of which could throw weight behind their support and they argued in favour of the concept .
nor could the performance potential of the proposal which would give the raf a twin engine design faster than the supermarine spectre which was about to enter service .
it was pointed out that those insects were a source of annoyance as was the concept as far as the ministry was concerned so they went with a supernatural type name which for some reason best known only to themselves was favoured by the air ministry at this time .
this extra capacity and performance lead to the formation of specialist squadrons operating at section level and therefore enabling one squadron to attack two or three targets simultaneously or at intervals that would disrupt and confuse the german defences .
colons is now my favourite explanation for the red flashes .

my generation followed the boomers and was arguably the most fucked over by their selfishness but if you get out of your box and hang out anywhere with " average australians " you will realise that regardless of age there is a lot of ignorance out there and it has been thoroughly exploited .

in actuality the scottish and irish saltires are counterchanged rather than the irish saltire being " moved off centre a bit to show the scottish saltire is n't a fimbriation " .
in the event of scotland leaving the union , this counterchanging would not be required though , but rather than the red saltire being simply moved to be centred on the diagonals , it would effectively double in thickness as the counterchanging is removed .

with this in mind , having rethought , i think that hermione would be initially confused by rose 's behaviour ( before transformation ) , and become frustrated with her , possibly causing pain to rose , but once rose is able to make it clear that she , or now he , is transgender , then for hermione it would explain everything .
i think the fact that hermione would now have a reason for her ( former ) daughter 's strange behaviour would make her accept it , and embrace it .

we had relatively few fans before the 1950s , everyone jumped on the bandwagon when flage were being won for fun , then 30 years of being run like a turkish whorehouse knocked off several generations of fans ( including people who realised they liked watching richmond at the mcg and st kilda at moorabbin better post-1965 ) and left us perilously close to a merger with fitzroy in 1986 .

i am not telling others what to like and not to like.i am just exposing truth , that people who have issues with the current lore , have issues with sexual orientation , but hide it under pretence of we liked his old lore.oh please , spare me the bullshit.we all know what this is all about.the current lore gives us more insights into ionia , darkin , and varus origins.with the release of more lore , riot has to update old lore that is not in any with the current narrative story.varus as a darkin , needed to get a lore that is updated , and he got it.from every point of view , it was better and people are just triggered of him having 2 gay guys inside.for god 's sake , you do n't even have to read his lore or comics that riot released , just play varus and pretend that new lore does n't exist if you want.i do n't want to argue any longer , it 's amusing to me tho that people still have issues with sexual orientation of a fictional character i. 2019 .

so , the way my lucid dreaming gets activated is by one of two ways : either the dream is a dream i 've had before , so for a while during the second or whatever - time dream i will feel really uncomfortable and sort of itchy until i realise it 's because i 've had the dream before , and then i 'll start lucid dreaming ; or i will wake up in the middle of a dream - which happens pretty much all the time - and if i fall back asleep quickly while thinking about that dream , i 'll be able to go back to it , even rewind it by five or ten minutes , and will then be lucid dreaming .

horde who just want to get to their dungeon safely can group up and it is a little bit safer , but if they run into an alliance deathball they will die regardless , so they are more likely to be travelling solo .
i adore the scents that they come in , but they 're not my favourites .
personally what i do to make my showers extra special is use my favourite scrub , a soap / shower gel , my favourite shower oil or body conditioner and then a body lotion after .

i started seeing a therapist for my previous relationship where i got lied to all the time and made to feel like it ’s my fault so my therapist made me google ‘ coercive control ’ and i started realising so much stuff so google it and if it sounds like him then get out of the relationship and move on because it ’s not healthy , it will be hard at first but trust me u can do it and you ’ll be so much happier after hope this helps xx

if you imagine treating a dog like we treat dairy cows and calves , and realise how the industry protects abusers and prosecutes whistleblowers and undercover investigators it ’s pretty easy to snap out of what we ’ve been conditioned to accept , and want to reject products of the industry rather than gobble them up like a good little consumer .
the alternatives are getting really decent now , it ’s just a bummer that stuff like cultured non dairy cheeses are not cheap cause they are n’t subsidised the way the dairy industry is .

she also has the ability to empathise with others , though she chooses to ignore it in favour of practicality when need be .

the choice of a paler blue as the official shade is relatively modern , as historically it was non - standardised , and although \generally\ the blue of the st andrew 's flag was paler , this was initially the case for most land - based heraldic ( and vexilogical ) blues compared to their naval equivalents .
the colour chosen by scotland is now , largely , respected by flag makers throughout britain - although there are still problems with overseas manufacture .
historically all that would have been required would be that the blue was recognisably such against the expected backgrounds where a particular flag would see use , and that the colour would be reasonably stable .

guardiola thought that laporte can single handedly carry the entire defence without kompany , but laporte is injured and now the whole team is so shaky at the back .
i hate to be the blunt one here , but you have just checked off every single red flag of domestic abuse : --he got angry and purposefully hurt you --afterwards he apologised and said he loved you --you insist he 's not like this ( other than those other times when he 's like this ) --you say cause you 've been together so long you should n't give up on him .
that would explain it , i got ff9 for christmas 01 and we had the chrome discs edit : after checking my copies i have both a white sst and a chrome set but the white set has no art

what he never told her as he left the crossroads -- that strange , beautiful realm that she always described as grey and dreary -- was that kieran had said something to him .
i think this is very much a case of you need to do something to try and fix it if it works then the problem is solved if it does n't then you need a new group of friends allow me to put it this way , you should tell them exactly what 's on your mind and it will either result in them realising that they have been leaving you out or it becoming clear to you they do n't want to spend time with you .

i 've read it and it 's , for the most part , what i wanted for a continuation of the epilogues .
the epilogues took a plunge into a much darker / bleaker reality than what the webcomic was and it felt like it had matured after all these years .
homestuck2 feels like a welcome mix of the more mature themes from the epilogues while adding back some of the whimsy the webcomic had .

it wo n't bring in new fans , as the entry point is getting greater than ever before ( 8000 pages + epilogues , whoof , and who the fuck would want to keep going after epilogues ) .

one thing you 'll see a lot is a statistic on how much more frequently children with adhd are told off or critiqued on their adhd behaviours than other kids even if they are n't diagnosed .
but additional funfact , the impulsivity is what often leads to dangerous behaviours ( whether being actually dangerous or us not thinking things through before we jump into something ) , so it is something to be mindful of , and it probably has plenty of research and advice online , so i 'd suggest having a bit of a google to learn more .

a lot of the more right wing people ( not centrists or centre right , right wing ) have been disenfranchised by society .
they are faced with a choice of being ostracised by their friends or join in on the mockery .
irony at its finest as it often includes bitching about virtue signalling . (
yes i ’m also aware that my comment is infact virtue signalling a section of society , that is why it is an inherently flawed term , and using it in the same context others do is so much fun for me ) so anyway .
also , shades of a colour or something like blue to red would work really well

in the former , either the entire fallopian tube is removed , or else just the part in which the embryo / foetus is implanted .
in the later , the fallopian tube is opened and its contents ( the embryo / foetus ) is removed , but the fallopian tube is left in place .
the justification is that in the former the embyro / foetus is only indirectly killed but in the later it is directly killed .
personally , i struggle to see the moral difference between the two procedures in terms of what happens to the embryo / foetus – the embryo / foetus dies either way , i ca n't understand how whether it dies " directly " or " indirectly " could morally matter .

i onced had an upstairs neighbour who kept moving their furniture but went we went up to complain , it was an empty house
the cancellation department is probably deserted .
this is the disc golf equivalent of the clip hot rod made to try and make money for his stepfather ’s heart surgery .
lol you mean your girlfriend has two different coloured boyfriends !
think the hair kind of have a lack of colour but the outfit is perfect
i went off the rails for a while when i was 16/17 , i dealt with it okay ( or what i thought was okay ) for the first few months and then it just erupted , failed my first year of a levels and had to resit , was suicidal ... but i had some counselling , antidepressants for a while , and decided it would make my mum and auntie more proud , and do them more justice when it comes to honouring them to make something of myself and my life .
to really understand the pros and cons ill just make a list for each wep going in order from worst to best sabres .
as for the sabre itself it can be a very deadly weapon against 30 % of npc opponents .
to tldr sabres , it can destroy peasants who ca nt afford armour .
against any oppoent wearing any type of mail nullfies a sabres damage immensly .
so yes you can use a sabre and kill , but its the least effiecent weapon to kill with .
if you are going to wield an axe the only viable one is heavy plated battle axe with the spiked tip .
also note , the axe is gon na clip into henry 's char model .
as for actuall killing power of the axe yea its pretty good , but ya know its just not that great .
because they can damage right through ab opponents armour .
just shit defence .
you 're entitled to your opinion , of course , but to me the entire aesthetic of your construction is pretty much " made from old parts with recovered designs " .
petra herself remarks how nobody 's really doing science at the moment , they 're more just figuring things out from archaeological records .
no one here was justifying hitler 's behaviour .
that means everyone able needs to be talking to their family , friends and coworkers about labour 's policies , and motivating them to get out and vote !
fancy some labour party related chat ?
come and say hi on the r / labour discord sever : removedurl i am a bot , and this action was performed automatically .
all i 'm hearing is that you are too worried that something may happen to your cat so you molly cuddle them and do n't let them explore your behaviours . ”

chickens will eat their own eggs if they realise they can be food .
chickens will eat each other if they realise they can be food .
i said 5 words , pretty hard to make a judgement off that dontcha think ?
i recognise the advantages of being part of a large bloc especially in a time of superpowers , usa , china and the threat of russia .
he actually is happy i organise him this way as he has adhd so he can forget or be distracted if there s not a visual cue for what he needs to be doing .
if you can find a man who will put in the extra care towards you then organising not taking the 2nd shift becomes way less of a big deal .
i never knew that - always assumed you could join either faction and it was just for flavour .
i reeeally want legalisation so i can buy weak weed that i can smoke on the reg , like my friends get out a fag and i either have to smoke a blunt and get super high , or i do n't get to join in :/ i do also like getting absolutely melted sometimes though ( like in about 2s now my parents have gone to bed lmao )
my mum worked hard to clean up and she got custody of my real sister 2 years later she had to jump through a lot of hoops like moving out of our family home to a new neighbourhood .
oh shoot i just realised it did n't post two images .
i can empathise somewhat with " letting yourself go " if you 're self esteem is so low that you do n't believe anyone would ever find you attractive , why go to any effort to maintain your appearance ?
if it 's necessary to store the produce in a fridge , due to unfavourable climate , it is important to put it into an airtight container to protect it . "
you ’re our neighbour , you ’re always welcome here .
as for privatisation ... it was a bit of a dingus move in that it set up literal monopolies over routes .
the buses of paid actors showed up
now i ’m a little torn about what ’s worse , watching the same roster of sappy christmas movie classics that we ’ve all seen a dozen times or watching newly made movies that at least have new sappy dialogue and minor plot details , even if the story is equally predictable .
tone of dialogue dialogue . (
tone of dialogue dialogue . (
you do n't have to do it for every single line of dialogue .
characters act horrible , they try and find a way to solve it without apologising , it fails , they make up for it , rinse and repeat .
we would need the media to become more fair and we would need the public to embrace ideas of the left more ( or we move towards the centre ) a minority government could go a long way to getting in a position in the future for a majority as long as labour were able to pass their legislation , specifically stuff to do with the media .
will be one of my favourite spurs players of all time for sure
i tried doing a black once and it came out grey 😂 😂 😂
i 'm starting to see a pattern over here of you liking grey and red .
thinking of buying this too but i do n't wanna risk it if it ends up getting cancelled and refunded through points .
it 's because so many think that way , so the only two parties that ever get voted in out labour and conservatives
also honour for most of the upgrades and when you do the chores .
realised he might have lived with his head blacked out also , i have survived quite a few raids with a blacked out thorax !
best 4th line centre in league .
deputy speaker , has the prime minister engaged with the labour party in replacing the member that was removed from the electoral reform committee ?
and gently .. i do n't think they know how capitalising initials work
he s not been good but he also faced two top 10 defences recently , the cardinals are middle of the pack and kupp should get opportunities .
but like another poster here very aptly pointed out , its the realisation that i 'll never be part of society in a way that i feel belonging that crushes me .
once released , they 're on a life licence which means they 're under probation supervision until they die and they can be recalled to prison if they ever breach the terms of their licence .
from what i remember in past interviews with cryptic , they said the confusion of flying a perfect 3d shape in space , not knowing which way you 're facing or turning was the main reason why we would probably never see cubes / spheres as playable ships , and probably why borg cooperative ships in dr were designed with their own aesthetic in mind , in the likely situation where they would become playable ships .
idol friendships are my absolute favourite , like watching tae dance across the stage to seo joon lol
i do realise all the drawbacks of distributed parity raid , but i do n't think mere bitrot or ube during rebuild could have caused damage to so many ( did n't have time to check all of them yet ) files .
every day i 'm still upset they tore that old theatre full of history down instead of restoring it / fixing it up and making it into something cool .
oohh yesss maybe like a greyish blue pixie , or maybe purple
it was something like " what is your favourite subreddit ? " ,
take a look at this map :  edmonton has basically two big commercial / industrial areas ( in grey ) - north west and south east ( plus ne , but that 's mostly not developed yet ) .
how can the head rest look grey but he looks black with no lights on ?
while i do n't think anyone can visualise how something would look in this kind of hyper - dimensional space , we have tools that enable us to quantify and calculate it .
their deradicalisation attempt only resulted in making them worse as the guys worshipped the baddest most beheadingist isis members
i have even more hate to writers ho have a very good fucking idea in their hands but just fill the thing with onichans , shitty dialogues and unnecesary character development
after having a judgement that us english spelling and grammar would n't be allowed , however , and then continuing to do so ?
sabres controlled most of the play , but ca n't score for shit .
nobody says you ca n't specialise and be paid more , we are just setting a minimum .
a real comrade would willingly give the fruits of his labour to the united people rather than suck the capitalist cock of uncle sam .
10 years of zero productivity growth is also labour 's fault .
as you leave , you realise you ’ve got a hell of a journey ahead of you .
if what the oracle said was true , then it ’s gon na be a hell of a time ... end of prologue
love the aesthetic but always looks like a sugar overload , my heart even cries just looking at it lmaoo
the incessant backpedalling and avoiding in your arguments is really quite amusing as well ...
the aesthetic we try to achieve .
i just found out they have a full flavour one too , which i have yet too try .
without , say the experience of fear , we would not be able to recognise danger .
i was addicted to things like instagram and shit , and i did n't know how and it was suntik i rearranged my phone icons , and whenever i did n't have something to do i mindlessly blocked on it but since i had moved it , it was n't there and it made me realise .
failing that , white has the tools in its pie to become the ultimate colour for fast combo , but that would require printing more cards like super - efficient tutors that would probably break every other format , so we have to hope to see them in commander specific products .
unfortunately , white is designed ( theoretically .... in practise , wotc often misses the mark ) to be very good at small creature aggro in 1v1 20 life formats .
maybe making it the primary colour for alternate win cons would be something ... edit : another idea , that i 'm a little surprised that they have n't tried more of , considering the popularity of edh and the well known problems of mono - w and mono - r in the format , is giving those two colours a bunch of pushed cards that encourage monocolor play .
as it stand now , eld aside , monocolor support seems to be in all five colours , with the most support in green and black , which do n't really need the help .

what nazis referred to as " the jew " , " the gay " or the unwanted- the communists labelled the bourgeoise .
old buildings are some of my favourite things to see and visit .
admittedly it ’s difficult to say that one old building is worth saving and another is n’t because it is n’t as pretty as aesthetics are subjective which is part of the problem .
i guess maybe the pic does n't show it well as it is n't the highest quality , but i can still some banding / dse / whatever you want to call on it on a grey screen .
two of my favourite bookstores .
that being said , + spell gear is ridiculously valuable as the damage with your crits is insane , but again , if a warrior / rogue gets uptime on you , armour and hp can be the difference .
i think it 's a decent gauge .
the air comes from a bypass of the engines which are running very optimised .
absolutely shameless , rat - like behaviour !
in my workplace harrassment and bullying is a continued behaviour .
is actually pretty good , a dry brush of black around the blend from red to black will give it more of a sooty look , then dry brush grey over the black to grey blend .
all the colours look good they just need bringing together , have a look at rocket launches and you will see what i mean .
he 's a humanist who finds some of israel 's behaviour abhorrent and calls it out for what it is .

some are saying nebulas are actually very blandly coloured , and i ’m picturing greys and browns , while others are saying these are very accurate .
scrims are when pros want to play only with themselves to practise for tournaments .
my favourite anime is completely different , though .
it 's partly the western worlds fault , we sold out our manufacturing industries until china became the worlds biggest factory , they 've consolidated that wealth & are now using it to their advantage , if we ca n't somehow equalise that , we 're all in the shit .
the rational thing would be to completely legalise all drugs in both nations and then massively undercut the cartels .
getting that axe was honestly a beautiful moment
5 years from now , mould resistant plants with minimal phenotypic expression will be deployed , yields will mirror illegal ( with equal cost per acre ) , and quality in molecule farming will become the norm for some outfits .

the route is indeed cancelled :  your only option is to take the refund and rebook on another carrier .
from my understanding you have a seminar you sign up for and another class you sign up for where you go to a local high school or middle school and essentially help students get the information they need for college and sort of serve as a college counsellor .
for armour , he will use similar measures .
as well , armour will slow them down .
shining in silver , money armour , acting as an amorphous sentinel moving the concrete in front of attacks , blocking large booze tentacles and blocking anyone who attempts a direct punch rush while they are skewered with the daggers .
a large sword backed with rebar will serve as the last line of defence .
the money spent , the cuts and mistakes made along the way to restore it no longer mattered , but the precious time he had gotten to spend with his son , that did , and that would stay with him long after the flames had smouldered out .
her dream vacation , the initial booking for their anniversary cancelled with the divorce .
i 'll do you a favour . "
he did n't care about anything but … he dialled tam , again , breathing slight .
those were not cancellations .
the scottish flag was whatever shade of blue the dyes used created - there was no effective method of standardising the colour .
also do n't forget to turn back the autopilot / stabilisation back on after a generator " failure " because of low rpm , because then it 's even wobblier ;)
i really think these people do n't seem to realise that you need this !

traveller touched eight worlds and hive went reeeeeee !
i only realised he did n't when i read your comment .
shutter island is a close favourite , though that 's more so of a psychological thriller .
we must remember that we 're taking vigilante action because the hkpf are n't enforcing justice anymore , from the taxi driver who ran over dozens of protesters to the mainlander who stabbed a couple and bite the ear off the councillor .
it is the production process which actually drains the resources in first place because the capitalist system is built on production of commodities not for the fulfilment needs but for a profit .
also space colonisation is not simply some fantasy .
the fact is that there are already government projects taking place in the us and in china with the aim of colonising the moon , mars and/or further afield within the next century .
you already have elon musk , through spacex , actively working towards the end of colonising mars , and there is plausible bourgeois motivation for wanting to go to mars - so that they can escape the hellworld they created and leave the rest of us to die slowly .
that is why they are interested in space colonisation on a capitalist basis .
space colonisation on a socialist basis , meanwhile , would allow for the resources gained from the interplanetary excursions to be distributed to the whole of mankind on earth as opposed to the planet 's capitalists .
i played as england tsl europe with 5 jet bombers and pretty much conquered most of europe with my bombers 1 modern tank army 2 mechanised armies 1 mobile artillery army and 2 spec ops army and france and germany in particular probably outnumbered me 5 to 1 but ai is shit at war and does n’t build aircraft .
remember neighbour had one , when i was a kid , he rarely drove it but let me sit in it once as i was just looking at it , was black and looked absolutely mint then , and by this pic it still looks good years later
mr deputy speaker , this bill is simply recognising the freedom of choice that parents have if they wish to circumcise their children .
indeed , the right honourable member must know of the holy prepuce - the supposed severed foreskin of the baby jesus himself .
she is seriously adorable , and obviously an expert on channelling manatees !
people that turn blind after an accident or so can sense some colours to a degree depending on how they became blind .
otherwise , there is no way for a completely blind person to sense the colour of anything .
forty buses in a row !
be sure when discussing pc performance to share your specs so other people can gauge the difference .
they will make a judgement and then she has to pay it .
i have to do a rewatch before i give a official judgement but i think most people wanted instant payoff and did n't care for the set up episodes .
3d print me some titanium armour and weapons
you spend sooo much time waiting to follow npcs to certain locations or listening to dialogue before you even get your next objective .
given that we have 32 combatants and they would need a unique battle quote and win quote against the other 31 , that ’s almost 2000 unique lines of dialogue .
we have that stereotypical scene where a student comes to you or you notice a change in behaviour , you do everything right and find out the student is being bullied or abused at home .
the list of departments that it houses include music , theatre and contemporary dance , along with a lot of business - related stuff .
you can look at the major sheets from both majors to kind of gauge what overlaps and what does n’t , and if you get in just plan ahead by taking classes in line with the econ accounting major sheet rather than the econ major sheet .
i 've come to the reluctant realisation that i 'll have to seek private therapy as the nhs service was about as useful as googling advice .
there is no reason why cross - party politics would n’t work - indeed there are plenty of cross - party groups and committees - you just gave to agree common ground rather than polarise mps and the nation .
even if they really like the apartment , have done tonnes of work on it and may even have been planning to live there themselves later in life ?
i want to vote labour because they have some good policies on other issues but this really does n't sound good to me .
haha i recognise !
the officials gave plenty of debatable and soft fouls throughout the game in liverpool 's favour and everyone is pointing at one slightly contentious issue that is n't remotely controversial to me , the highlights have completely misrepresented what happened

the alternative to salpingotomy ( removal of embryo / foetus from tube ) is salpingectomy ( removal of some or all of the tube itself ) .
either way , the embryo / foetus dies – i do n't see how it makes a difference whether it dies " directly " or " indirectly " .
but , if medical professionals say one way is better for the mother 's health and future fertility , then it is morally preferable to allow them to implement their best medical judgement ( subject to the consent of the mother , of course ) .
witcher 3 is my second favourite game to rdr 2 and the witcher 3 world gets stomped by rdr2 for immersion and attention of detail which if you told me this would happen back in sept 2018 , i 'd have laughed it off .
you realise they have ludicrous budgets with or without your additional support , right ?
tyr - hel voyager - colours sabaton - great war
it feels like old spy sat pictures of soviet icbm sites , except it 's in colour , you can buy it commercially online , the icbm is to carry people instead of warheads and is commercial itself , and the espionage is not an act of war but of fandom :)
i like to think of it as " play - by - play dialogue " , like a football announcer telling you what you are seeing as you see it .
it 's sloppy dialogue writing at it 's worst , like that infamous clip of that bad horror movie .
however the defence used by zimmerman ’s lawyers is almost exactly the same defence used in cases of police shooting and killing unarmed civilians being a)the person believing that the victim was a threat and thus the shooting was in self defence and b ) stand your ground laws ( which is why police released zimmerman only hours after bringing him in )

too many people blowing smoke up their arses to realise they ’re carbon copies of other artists without any individuality themselves .
i got in trouble for wearing a hat inside after the day was over walking out to the buses .
in this view , models of state socialism that are also driven by growth are at least as bad as capitalism as they represent forms of monopoly capitalism on a state level and exploit workers free from labour regulations that exist in capitalist countries .
since starting to play this game , it did n't take long to realise that the only thing destroying ingress is the playerbase .
earlier a black labour politician was accused od writing his own racist letters .
lots of people make a concerted effort to minimise their impact because they understand the ramifications .
if i was aiming to point out graphical fidelity or image quality then fair play , but in this instance i ’m just quipping about a bit of dialogue and it seemed wholly unnecessary to go through the extra steps .
nta because emotional labour is to be split according to both partner 's needs and should n't fall as women 's duties .
when you calculate and murder a person , you do nt deserve any type of reward for doing a good act , or a change in judgement of your character .... being able to live your life in freedom is good enough for you .
what was your favourite part you worked on ?
some people tried to twist the show coming to a planned conclusion into a cancellation story .
literally , nothing will ever compare to my first viewing on infinity war - that 's the best theatre experience i 'll ever have
aesthetically beautiful and that ’s all you need sometimes
i 'll say personally i came here for the yak run which ended up cancelled .
practise every day , and you might eventually be able to .
downtobuck is a national treasure , one of my favourite channels
i also feel like it ’d be a waste to buy a disc when i already have the data on my ps4 .
then by all means , set your sights on levelling up .
if the earth were a disc , there would still be a curved horizon , and that curve would actually become more pronounced the higher you go , right ?
i beg to differ , for me 1 e + a can be vocalised incredibly fast , and since the ‘ t ’ sound relies on the same set of muscles / tongue movements ( therefore less efficient ) .
he would n't want people worshipping like it 's an idol or whatnot .

very ' 90s aesthetic .
also , many law firms nowadays moving towards tech look for expertise in info systems for organising their databases effectively etc ( in my firm , the technical analysts are very very useful in this regard ) defo speak to people in bis to get a better idea of what it entails !
barely a month ago you were regularly seeing very online lib dems gleefully talking about how they were going to overtake labour in this election and embed themselves as the main opposition party .
some jewellery stores lock their doors when there ’s a customer in there in case of robbery , or he may have thought the cashier had hit a panic button locking the doors .

he believed that conventional religion and all kinds of orthodoxy oppresses us by stunting our nature , and the tiger symbolises a natural force of dynamic , uncontrollable energy with the possibility of violence , but in a positive way .

i 'll start , the labour party is n't as progressive as they think they are .
it ’s just frustrating that his community embraces train ’s idiocy and memes and yet they do n’t have any problem in cancelling and shitting all over any women that destiny hangs out with .
this was a extremely bad judgement call on her part .

the idea of a labour snp coalition makes me feel like i ’m in front of a warm fire .
a genuine thank you , labour have been far from perfect but to lend your vote against your own personal best wishes is a selfless thing .
the issue is then , the system which disregards the individual and collective interests of the lower - classes , in favour of the interests of the few in the ruling - class , driving the whole of forsaken humanity to destruction .

upvote questions that you recognise but you can not do .
went to counselling , trained myself to manage my afflictions , and simply got out more .
in my experience , counselling and medication are one part of managing these things .
further , i was drawing attention to the hilarious hypocrisy of the left and how they would n't dare criticise apple or facebook for hiding billions in irish shell companies ( ireland is a tax haven ) by bezos is literally the devil for giving 98 million to charity , because under their extremely statist tax plans he 'd be forced to give 8 billion , in addition to the 160 billion he 's already invested in the economy , the 500,000 + jobs he 's created and the multiple millions he 's invested in key r&d sectors the government specifically supports and tries to encourage through tax incentives so that companies with the capital to invest in such ventures are in fact enticed to try and develop these amazingly prosperous technologies .

the pair are travelling at incredible speeds in midair , making them hard to hit in the first place , and up ’s b pre and spd means it can easily deflect anything that comes it ’s way with air blasts while staying prepared for the upcoming battle against tom alcove .

generally i do n't think there should be any set allowance afforded to the defence in these situations , referees control the game , are responsible for time - keeping and letting the game flow as much as possible , it makes sense that they can allow this kind of thing .

stoics should not participate in patterns of behaviour which are overall harmful as this is irrational .
ergo , stoics should not partake in meat consumption where produced under modern , industrialised methods .
presumably the author does not in principle exclude stoics from partaking of hunted meat or those raised on smallholdings , for example - it is the most prevalent , industrialised form of production which is being critiqued , not meat itself .
in fact , given the generally irrational behaviour of much of the human population , it seems better to err on the side of caution and make the most rational decisions and sacrifices ourselves , rather than hope someone else will do it for us so we can partake in a little sensual indulgence .
one of my favourite areas because there ’s virtually no barriers

it 's true that devs nowadays mostly favour resolution over fps , but it 's waaaaay too early for 8k .

si - on saw his father when he was terminally - ill and close to dying and he was quite traumatised of unexpectedly seeing him too .
guess it ’s too much to hope dynamite could give us a little background on these women , maybe let the champion tell us how she feels since her last defence , maybe not beat the number one contender in a pointless tag match and tell us a bit of her background ...
i feel the same about the endeavour ...
i was about to downvote and realised what i was doing .
what was her favourite toy or thing to do ?
the favour enjoyed by the church during mr lee ’s presidency , which ended in 2013 , was a sign of the huge influence of evangelical protestantism in south korea .
the country has more protestant organisations , about 55,000 of them , than convenience stores .
they organise large protests which can succeed in blocking events such as gay - rights rallies that offend their beliefs .
kim yong - min , who runs a small church in a basement in seoul , says his organisation is trying to stop right - wing christians from meddling in politics .
i do n't think they officially said it 's cancelled .
then take an xbox disc and shove it up your ass .
the world just needs to realise that everyone matters , does n't matter about gender , race or anything else .
i was told you can never actually solicit cancellation , but you can possibly say something like " unable ifr left traffic due to ifr inbound , say intentions . "
i did n’t even know their names today but like we went to out and got food and it was fun and they like me and i feel bad cause i wo n’t see them for weeks edit : just realised this is less about band and more about people but still
you can use flashlights as a crosshair / guide even in their current state too , in fact it is one of their purposes in real life when wearing nvgs as you ca n't really ads and you have to use your infrared flashlight to gauge where you 're pointing exactly .
greedo and cad are probably the best easier access alternatives , cad brings a little more utility with the dispel / stun on his special , greedo brings a good chunk of damage if the rng gods favour you a more budget bh team would be zbossk , boba , dengar , greedo , cad , this is the team i used to unlock chewie as i did n't have jango or embo at the time .
it 's built much like a colourless eldrazi deck , but taking advantage of white removal .
the best thing about including white is that i can ramp hard at the start of the game , then stabilise with boardwipes in the mid game .
i also get to run some lifegain , which again , lets again me stabilise after a slow start .
team ) ( modelling ) and a very nice definition !
yeah , it was only a 4 game sample , and the defence was n't anything to write home about , but it was blatantly a very weird decision , and it clearly has n't paid off .
i doubt it ’ll work in the long term with this girl if she lives in paris and he ’s travelling with his rugby but he seems happy and busy in ireland .
i will be voting for labour , i do n’t agree with them on everything , like nationalising the royal mail but they are the lesser of two evils .
you can trust them on one thing only and that is to not honour their manifesto , as they never do .
at least with labour they look at the countries problems and look to solve them even if radically , they have the average persons interests at heart .
also because we have a limited capacity to humanise and empathise and beyond that it is difficult to generate a strong emotional response .
thybulle is n't a player that covers deficiencies on defence .
he has to rely on having a good defensive team because his defence is good because of his instincts off ball .
however , now our yvr to hkg flight is now cancelled which complicates things .
further , i now worry about my return flight from hkg to yvr being cancelled .
he totally should have pulled up and set the offence .

the scanners are only present at stations with locked turnstiles , for buses and most light rail line stations , you just show your mobile ticket / pass to the driver ( for bus ) or fare inspector if they turn up .

technicals in mexico are sometimes nicknamed ' narco tanks ' and were originally armoured shells over the top of normal trucks , but have gradually moved towards more low - profile vehicles such as these , which are easier to blend in with the normal civilian population .
some of them are outfitted with armoured ' bathtubs ' in the interior to provide armour to the vehicle without it being overtly visible .
as a result of this kind of armour being used that is not visible from the exterior on both sides rpg ’s and anti - armour weapons are being used to ensure a vehicle is killed .
one other example in the same style as this is slightly better , mounting a small rotating chair in the back for use by the gunner , which had an armoured back face to it .
would n't it make sense to take reasonable steps to reduce that , even if it is a cyclical thing and will happen over and over throughout the aeons ?

if you 're going to single out the conservatives , i m going to mention labour to balance that out .
like a lot of lefties , i 'm not a huge fan of blair and browns labour , but it was n't anywhere near as bad as the tories .

austerity was only brought about because of the ridiculous spending by the previous labour government .

only because conservative politicians like to invoke the slippery slope fallacy ; assuming that just because people vote for decriminalisation of sex work ( hint melbourne has legal , tax paying brothels and my local paper has escorts advertised , remember that for the next bit ) people will also vote to legalise euthanasia or decriminalise drug use or the like .

i 'm in two minds about flavoured nicotine liquid .
on the one hand , i 'd stop vaping immediately if i had to vape it without flavours .
nicotine is not an appealing taste and unlikely as it would seem to non smokers , many cigarette smokers enjoy the scent and flavour of tobacco .
on the other hand , flavoured liquids are clearly very similar to flavoured cigarettes which have been illegal for decades because of the argument that they are designed to appeal to kids .
it seems as though that would discourage kids from trying it with nicotine as the nicotine would be harder to get than the flavour .

saddest feeling i had was realising i never existed .
colours , made up words , like they held real significance .
ca n't even capitalise the first letter of " boots " ?
i just got given a bottle of quink blue black someone 's was going to toss and was gon na sell it coz i already have this colour from another brand .. if it 's water proof then i 'm all in
i apologise if i overreacted , but i read it as saying " oh get over it , this happens all the time " and that is not at all what they were saying .
the sabres , apparently not knowing the dangers of signing a breakout player after a contract year signed him to six - year , $ 27 million contract .
the clone wars was a brutal conflict that spanned the entire galaxy under a morally grey umbrella , so when it was over thanks to the rise of the empire , much of what the troops had fought for was all for naught .
it does n't work and they know that but do n't wanna admit that fact as they 'd have to retrain their staff and maybe take a year break to re - organise .
much better options out there in silver or grey or bronze .
you should also be thinking about how you are going to sterilise your media and any glassware , since i assume you do n't have access to an autoclave .
pink and white are one of the best colour combinations tbh .
unless i got wooooshed , 13 is also a number neighbour of 23
once you 've had full access to steam you ca n't go back to a limited catalogue .
you know i never even thought about it like that , very good point thank you , my only reason for wanting to own a semi auto would be for fun ( target shooting at a local gun club ) and maybe home defence but unlikely , i currently own a lever action for that exact same purpose and am a - ok with it edit : i do n’t store my lever action at my home even it ’s at the gun club
but just be the grey man , keep your head down and you 'll get through it .
to be fair , humour is subjective , and i found it to be funny .
you honestly read this somewhere and never once thought " gee , that sounds like some bullshit trump - worshipping propaganda " ? ? ?

not paying attention , being distracted and committing a crime is not a defence that holds up in a court of law .
spacebar to harvest / pickup the closest stuff f to attack the closest hostile ctrl + f to attack anything that can be attacked including friendlies like butterflies , pigs , chester , your own walls do n't fight without armour in the first season eating butterflies is the easiest , most abundant form of healing in fights kiting is key : almost every enemies you can bait them to attack you then come during their attack cooldown to wack their face .
you 're going to screw up a lot when learning the various enemies ' timings though , so do n't forget to equip your armour explore a lot early game do n't stop at night , campfires are only useful if you need to cook stuff , otherwise just make a torch do n't starve did i mention that armour is not optional ?
the other half i think can be solidly rebutted , perhaps by someone more passionate about labour than i ... my dad used to be " frightened " of corbyn ( bizarre opinion , if not planted by the press ) .
the whole bill smells like being mostly a virtue signalling exercise to " the base " .
the australian national anthem 🗿 🗿 🗿 i do nt know what i thought the words were but they were not it , i apologise to my country
taking offence at lol does too .
people do n't realise that this kind of unearned opportunity can crush delicate young talent before it 's even gotten started .
xiv 's pull is all in it 's aesthetic and delivery and not in it 's nonexistent gameplay depth , but that 's perfectly okay as that 's entirely by design .
could n’t help you with the psi , unfortunately the gauge on my pump is broken .
there s a pool and everything , its quite close to everything but also not right in the centre of the hustle and bustle , good link to go to tanah lot and good link for drinks in canggu if that s your thing , beach a little walk down the road with a nice sunset if that s your thing .
without a functional dialogue it ’s hard to fix relationships so it ’s very important to have this back and forth .
edit : just realised you said he died in 1995 and not that he took you in at 1995 , so you ’re not in your late 30 ’s .
the other one is definitely the aggressor , which makes me really sad because he ’s a lovely boy who loves playing and exploring , never gets tired of roaming around the house and has never showed any type of aggressive behaviour towards me .
labour are amazing on workers rights , healthcare and education , lib dems are great on evidence based science and agriculture policy ( big one for me as a scientist , despite hating most of their economic policy ) , green are good on environmental policy .
while uw tends to admit students of higher calibre , generally in future careers past the first job , nobody cares about your degree anymore .
however , i would prefer we had a vote no sorry , an roi constitutional referendum basic ' yes or no ' on whether posts obsessing about mods , discord , mods behaviour , mods on discord etc .
he said he had raised the problem of terrorists being released “ whilst ostensibly rehabilitated but still radicalised ” in many government meetings , before raising it with mr johnson in june 2016 . “
you will eventually have to realise , maybe this is just the way they play .
he literally is given a god -tier weapon , a shotgun axe .
you can use it as an axe , shotgun , or switch the axe around and use it as a bayonet .
decided to upgrade to a gtx 1060 but realised its incompatible with my motherboard , so need a new motherboard and decided to get a new processor too .
that means everyone able needs to be talking to their family , friends and coworkers about labour 's policies , and motivating them to get out and vote !
fancy some labour party related chat ?

i 'm on an urology ward because the orthopaedic ward is full , hence the staff do n't know how to move me without hurting me .
became severely constipated , i cried and begged for an enema and was told not until i try to clear it myself ...... which i had 8 times .... (i'm not allowed to put weight on my injured leg and ca n't use the toilet without doing so ) resorted to digging the faeces out of my anus with my bare hands .... didn't work .
the night shift not wanting the hassle of him kicking off have relented and the 2 of them are talking loudly , not considering the 3 other patients in the room who are trying to sleep i requested to be moved to a orthopaedic ward and to speak to someone is charge .
i followed the tracking link from my order page and saw that the shipment had been cancelled by the sender .
this is not the same thing as my order being cancelled , though .
the aesthetics were amazing !
labour 60 % green party 20 % liberal democrats 13.3 % brexit party 6.7 % bxp on nhs , the rest generally seems to align with what i expected .
in the end , the meeting was cancelled on polański ’s request .
i just want to honour your effort going to yt and searching the video so anyone else can skip that .
interesting stuff , but that site is brutalising my phone .
then you need to outlaw all sorts of behaviour .
practising boxing might reduce aversity to violence and cause streetfights .
the suggestion that you need to remove any behaviour that might increase the risk of crime at all is insanity in the context of a free society .
they are still trying to get religious organisations to support it .
did n't know taking the axe back for a year made them shit themselves everyday for a year .
now all the buses have contactless , so you do n't even meed to ask the driver for anything unless you still want to pay in cash .
after 17 years of working in a call centre .
i got down apologising to a fine art .
that dialogue can also be read as red : i do n’t know your name .
just as this dialogue can be read as , woman : you ’ve been here before .

i know people are different and there 's no right way to deal with behaviour like this but i 'm telling i would 100 % have moved out after high - school and never talked to my dad again until i get a big fat sincere apology .
b : colour changes each strike(red and blue).also an electric flair at the edge of the ability range .
ult : her tsukiyomi will be now have colours similar to a police beacon / siren ( flashing red and blue ) .
at least let me play through again with a nice lightsaber colour from the beginning
they also include colour temperature as a 5000k bulb will be a lot whiter but not illuminate as well as a 3500k bulb .
no need to apologise .
2x3 freeze arrows will make them drop out of the sky ( 1x3 with good mods on lower difficulties , if they are not corrupted like the one in the final quest outside meridian ) directly onto their ugly beaks , where you can take them to the cleaners with your favourite weapon ( i recommend the  from the  ) .
no need to apologise , it 's easy to misinterpret stuff written by random internet strangers .
i indulged in quite a bit of reckless behaviour on my honeymoon immediately preceding our wedding ( lots of drinking , pot and mushrooms , etc . )
e.g at 65 i get that you might need x amount of money for travelling and enjoying life ... but at 85 unless you are super lucky and you have a healthy life no backpains , being able to walk and travel i do n't see how you 'll be spending that much money .
fair play about the wanking comment , that 's just my schoolboy humour , ironically enough .
anyway , thanks again for a civilised discussion .
we watch movies , series etc where colours are explicitly used to convey emotions but i do n't think the colours themselves have any direct effect on us .
red is probably the colour of " love " to a lot of single women who watch romantic movies where red is used as colour of love but to single women that watch action movies with the antagonist associated red , it probably is the opposite fealing of " love " .

one difference is when i did it on ps4 , i could use the glitch to get into new austin early as i wanted the lote outfit as early as possible / before the epilogue .
on one level it 's an artefact from a previous design , and it 's not necessarily necessary .
if you pick from the top of the list , adding a new character would necessitate the moving of the entire waiting list down to create a space , since new characters are automatically prioritised .
having considered all this , picking from the end is physically less work than picking from the start , and it minimises the manipulation of slips of paper .
from 1923 until 1945 we had conservative prime ministers ( torries ) , ~~only~~ only a 6 years dip that was a labour james ramsay macdonald .
from 1918 : 54 years under pure conservative 31 years under labour 4 years under coalition of labour and torries in the past 10 years we have n't had a non - conservative government .
the freedom to criticise religion is all that i really ask for , at the end of the day .
i 'm sceptical .
oh , and i know some people argue that the nano s is n't really sff but it was honestly in my price range and i fell in love with the aesthetics .
i am however recognising these lies more and more as the happen and am starting to catch myself .
i had some unexpected expenses which blew the budget and i reverted to old behaviours .
obviously you would need to gauge the situation , such as it being accidental or not or if the other person actually could pose a threat to me .
would prefer colour laser , with scanner and english menus .
if you had the magnet in a moulding with a shape that lifted up and away from a reed switch as you rotated the moulding you could turn a current on or off ... however , i 'm not sure if that 's what you 're asking .
the ones i never realised though - seeing eye dog ( which i always took to be the american equivalent of guide dog ) , dumpster , and realtor are actually copyrighted terms , not general terms .
i 'm sure you can find economists who 'd be willing to be paid by the sun or mail to go with that ... however a vast number agree with labour 's economic policy .
usually hand job or blow job and i often return the favour .
bunch of greta worshipping , baby killing la la land lunatics .
nta i mean yeah it 's weird as hell but you 're entitled to keep your ( labelled ) stuff in your ( assigned ) space and choosing to actively steal that comes with risks .
i m breaking the comfort - seeking behaviour i will admit there have been setbacks like any addict .
socialising went out for dinner and drinks one evening .
battle starts and it was hard to tell if it was a different colour but i could have sworn i heard that shiny noise .
the aeon exotics , by comparison , are virtually useless by themselves .
it takes other guardians using them to make them remotely effective , but with how many mods , better exotics , or weapon perks there are in the game to aid with ability cooldown , the aeons are a complete waste of an exotic slot .
aeon is neither .
psa : no one makes jokes about your skin colour
if you fail to realise this then go back to secondary school .
i could see i was trying to control others behaviour and trying to predict outcomes .
i realised that this predicting the future tendency was bug in my software .
next day he apologised , i did a the ' treat his like a little boy ' , said nothing , just a little hug , some eye contact and i went back to my work .
i am prioritising systems over goals .
i 've worked on my finances , squirrelled some cash into my emergency " go plan cash " & saved for christmas etc .
i played it just never realised it .

but i ’d still be very sceptical about this .
consider going to a councillor who specialises in addiction .
damascus is the bees knees aesthetically but just an added cost for no particular reason .
you do realise crims , esp the racers , have been asking for this for a couple of months .
that 's my favourite kind of sister .
funny enough , when i do fight back , while the tears flow and i am labelled every possible permutation of asshole , the storm finally does break , and he asks for a hug .
if that is what he ’s doing his bbiq must be a lot lower than previously thought , because letting things “ work themselves out ” when you ’re supposed to be the centrepiece of the offence is a stupid idea that obviously wo n’t work .
wow this is a bad start with the shooting a tonne of good looks
despite rumours , actions or appearances to the contrary , we 're actually low maintenance and easy to please .
brig can carry games with large heals and armour , so building rally is a priority for her .
one is a weird guy 11.5 oz stretch denim which has a bit of a nicer fit and is " ash grey " the other is easy guy 13 oz 100 % cotton rope dyed dark blue denim , the fit is n't quite as nice and slighter higher rise but still good .
but i like the colour a little better .
with help from the mrp community i think i 've internalised this now .
every week that passes i learn and internalise more .
i ca n't have any addiction controlling me in any way shape or form , it 's a chink in the armour .
buying toys has really opened my colour choices to me so much and i know now what i like / don't like so much better than before , and what is appealing to my eye .
and yes you 're the virtue signalling idiot .
excellent , car is perfect , has had a tonne of work done in the last year .
the design and shirt is aesthetically bad , but the message it conveys is aesthetically good .
what i did n't realise was that she had gone to the bedroom to pester my husband , so he tried to get rid of her by getting her to ask me to turn on this cartoon .
on saying that , even if i had realised , my answer would have been the same : no .
me , to my husband , when we noticed one of our upstairs neighbours was moving but did n't know if it was the normal one or the shitty insane one .
pattern size is the same regardless of gauge .
also , super made realise how strong the bond between goku and vegeta realise and is the main reason why it ’s my favourite .

spending time with my dads made it possible to notice how so many poor behaviours in life are simply a misdirected form of motherly attachment .
my numbers are above but note i did n't realise the dl was only 1x5 and i could have gone heavier had i known .
it ’s incredibly creative and brave that you are inviting questions so ... what ’s your favourite song ?

oys 12 stats : age : 29 , ht : 6'1 wt : 215 - 220 gym : that weird disc / poky back pain has returned after being a little overzealous on good mornings .
it 's a joke about the fact that they now expect their customers to essentially do untrained and unpaid labour for them ( scanning their own shopping ) .
anyway , my advice would be to stay away from dating sites because that ’s where men show their true colours .
so many people seem to get it is to start with counselling and look to move out if he ca n’t get it together .
internal monologue ) regardless of what others think or make it out to be , i am my own judge and i know that i was caught in the " crossfire " ----this sounds very womanese hamster what 's funny is a year ago i would have felt guilty beyond belief , talked to my husband about it , been worried about the relationship blowing up , but also secretly been so proud that i am alpha and men want me , achievement unlocked !

frame finally recognised the often used " you seem angry " shit test .
i did n't capitalise on the good mood it put his in that night though .
i did do some deering when some historical topics where my behaviour was apparently bad was brought up .
i did do a better job about stfuing initially and also refused to apologise about something i had apologised for before when i was fully blue pilled .
tried to broken record a little bit by maintaining that i wanted to keep the topic to the night of the fight and not on past behaviours .
act respectfully and politely and encourage others to do the same but if you 've the time and effort to put in then make up a billboard of your own saying something like ' abortion is a human right ' or your favourite slogan and asking people not to cause a fuss as these people protest their flawed ideology .
childhood trauma like that is almost definitely contributing to the self doubting - if you 're verbally abused by someone sometimes your brain can take on part of that role and say horrible or self doubting things to yourself because you 're used to that from the abusive person if you have irrational thoughts that you feel you need to act on like in your example , maybe try to rationalise with yourself that they are nt real and try to unpick the irrational thought patterns , even just for a short time before you act on them
this is a grey area .

on the topic of holding cyclones in the original concept of the star runner cig claimed that it would n't be able to fit vehicles aside from bikes and the grey cat due to a narrow ramp and low roof .
this is normal behaviour .
what an insult it is to the real saviours of very sick patients to have idiots , including the saved patients , hand the credit to a cartoon character born out of superstition .
a pinkish - yellowish colour
those great big expressive eyes of his .... sometimes i think this could be the most dangerous joker of them all,;cuz he 's so damn likeable .
some embroidery needles and some pearl cotton in size 8 & 12 in some standard colours are never a bad idea .
so will megane , he 's got will power rivalling mumen rider 's
two are too brown , the bedroom is too grey , etc .
you can then have two seperate cue buses one for foh and one for monitors .
i 've seen studies that show average abortions happen around the time the foetus develops nerves so when the abortion happens it can feel it .
you can tell its fake because the cheap fake blood stained the fake skin moulding they put on .
it does have the newer case model numbering system , but the older calibre numbering system , which is not unusual , as seiko would have used up their older movements first in newer cases before making new movements - as i said , the movement calibre number is 957 , which is a 6602 in the newer system .
the serial number beginning with 4d says that it was cased in december 1964 , which fits with the transition between the old and new calibre and case numbering systems being around 1963 - 1964 .
1963 is also when seiko started using their current logo , which you can see on the watch ’s dial - it would previously have been branded as a “ seiko sportsman ” ( calibre 66 ( the time - only , no - date version , previously calibre 956 ) and 6602 ( with - date ) watches ) .
yeah what that guy said , the wobble and colour change .

she 's comparable to zenitsu ; she practised 1 form for 10 years straight until she reached its absolute limit

you do realise what that 's for right ?
cooke does show his limited knowledge though , he states whanganui used to be a labour stronghold all through the 20th century until 2005 , a which was true , but big electorate changes meant they were going to struggle once it included a lot of rural south taranaki .
it 's not the same electorate it was when it was a labour stronghold , which he does n't mention .
well i do nt think your sister and i would be a great match , no offence meant .

now they are progressively harmonising , i take it as a sign i am having some success in fixing my self .
i do n't bark back and i do n't engage , i simply realise that i do n't like that shit without feeling any need to get back at his .
this has helped his realise when he is being shitty and correct course .
this got me thinking about how one tends to plough on for years convincing one - self that the course is right .

of course this leads to the problem of us not recognising it as life at all , but that 's my own issue with the definition of life used by the field .
super bummed that it got cancelled .
i do n't know if it 's because i 've started to realise i really bought into this idea of the " prison " without even realising it , or if it 's my realisation that my persistance in trying to keep everyone else happy is fruitless .
now i realise this is the behaviour i have been subjecting my husband to for years .
but i have realised that in order to truly fix things here there are other things about me i need to work on first .
not saying you 're wrong at all , but the child centred life and excessive breeding was one of the things that stood out most to me when i moved here !
you 're working with six different dark greys here , and it sort of turns the whole visual into charcoal soup .
you only have a limited number of gear slots , you can implement talent trees or other forms to allow us to customise our build with interesting effects without locking in gear slots , i mean you could create a totally different character panel with 8 arbitrary slots that let you slot in objects that do exactly what you speak of , and give us a second panel to customise rare items with specific stats .

funny af and they have a big back catalogue
i tend to agree , i used them extensively in my invasion of ulthuan as malekith , saved me the need to sail back to naggarond after any disastrous battle ( something i have with the armies i 've inherited from moulder after a confed as ikit ) , which is excellent for a faction which is mostly about attacking rather than defending .
i have been internalising a mindset of " build the life you want and invite his along for the ride " as the way for me to grow and move forward .
this is probably very beta of me , but the night before i 'd spoken to my husband and just apologised for my behaviour and tried to apply some fogging to his comments .

why was the cello kill your favourite ?
hurr durr i think a typo where i wrote the exact opposite of my intended claim but my recipient was intelligent enough to recognise and correct due to the context , logic and likely meaning as irrelevant to a conversation about not following grammatical and spelling conventions hurr durr " fucking idiot !
every single printer / scanner i 've had i 've had to either navigate through labyrinthine menus do either scan documents or print in black and white , or the drivers constantly just freeze on me and stuff gets stuck in the queue for eternity or the fucker just stops working for asinine reasons like running out of colour .
no you fucker the colour cartridge died because it dried up because i print in colour once a year let me print these 2 pages of text in black and white you stupid fucking shit anyway printers are inter dimensional hell - spawn and unless you convince me otherwise , i 'm not paying that much for them edit : i 've never given laser a try

the music at the scotiabank centre is terrible in general .
yep lmao that s why its such a polarised line
but aj was dicking about and not putting them in line by raising time , for bad behaviour .

sometimes they need to be reminded of what is acceptable behaviours .

how did he earn profit if they are charging at a rate that is equal to the cost of the labour provided and paid the janitor the full value of the labour ?
behaviour keeps adding novelty after novelty with new low - tier killers , garbage - tier perks , and survivors that no one plays because their pained grunts are loud as shit .
of course if they were to change these perks there would have to be some tweaks to the baseline mechanics ( gens being slower , it being easier to break a chase ) but i 'm so sick of behaviour giving us baseline mechanics as perks .
but , it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court .
karl marx is cancelled .
he was n't canonised ?
athough even the stuff we 've seen so far has to be taken with a grain of salt as the game is nowhere near finalised yet .
maybe mixing up runners and shamblers ( like , the more decayed a zombie the more it shambles ) , children zombies ( them being harder targets and catch players off guard ) , crawlers who are quiet , armoured zombies that are either immune / resistant to headshots and maybe bloated zombies that can absorb more damage ?
you 're by far my favourite artist !
x200b ; there are of course women who can check their ego and realise be ok with a man who makes less money than her and kudos to them .
it 's not a big deal so i could really go either way but cancelling would save me one months annual fee and get me below the 5 card amex limit faster
whatever you were thinking about some weird rankings system to a lot rookie picks sounds like a bad idea , no offence .
iirc in moon cradle arc , asuna 's inner monologue think about how kirito seems a bit too protective of her all the time after the alicization stuff now recently ... as if he is so very scared that he might lose asuna too .
is my new favourite .
your should not have lied , obviously , but if you are using that to justify his behaviour then stop that right now .
i 'd settle for putting a sound - proof barrier in the back of the plane , and that is where anyone travelling with small children goes .
he 's been labelled a white supremacist because he likes white people and does n't want this process to continue like it is , naturally .
of course they 're all labelled alt right evil racist nazis but anyone to the right of mao is now anyway , so i do n't really care .
like everyone has become so comfortable with their judgement that they rely on the context of memes to reduce people down to something as minimal as possible to dismiss their points and what not .
but i agree with mothking , reach is unironically my favourite halo game and the game i poured the most time into by far .
that 's a real achievement - be proud of yourself and realise what that says about your ability to persevere .
to be clear , what i mean is saying ' i 'm an anxious person ' , ' i 'm a weak person ' , ' i 'm a disorganised person ' , ' i 'm an awkward person ' - that kind of stuff .

the day google opened ... it sounded great but it commercialised it very very fast , while at the same time started a race to the top of the search results mostly with glitz and flash with no real content .
lol it 's a gorgous axe .
i made a kill tally on my sniper , just reminds me of brothers in arms : hell 's highway , which was my favourite xbox 360 game about 10 years ago .

you could take a day - trip to atami and find the ropeway , where they have a collection of ageing ' 90 's arcade games housed in a poorly lit structure with paint peeling and wall cracks .
really brings the " dingy arcade " aesthetic .
the kmt suffered mass desertions as it relied on press - ganging to conscript soldiers , officers abused and terrorised soldiers to instil discipline .
while stalin officially recognised chiang kai - shek as the legitimate ruler of china and had a dim view of mao , he still had a vested interest in supporting the growth of the chinese communist party .
fourth , through the course of the chinese civil war , the pla besieged kmt isolated garrisons and encircled demoralised kmt armies , seizing their equipment outright .
for example , the us defence department sold m5 stuart light tanks for just $ 1000 each to the kmt .
since chinese intervention in the korean war occurred less than a year after the kmt 's defeat in the civil war , the pla had not yet demobilised .
yeh the entire thread would be shitting on the woman instead of gilding it and supporting the behaviour .
my favourite type of player is one who regularly beats defenders with the ball at their feet but does so without relying on pace , and that sums him up to a t. a lot of dribblers get buy primarily on physical prowess , just knock the ball past your man into space and sprint .. there 's no art to it , it 's just pure genetics really .
those gases just abandon us , hm ?
there are a lot of very hurtful questions and statements that are frequently said to infertile people , and the adoption question is usually at the top , and there is usually a fair amount of judgement behind that question , because people think that doing ivf is “ selfish ” , but those same people never seem to think that about couples having multiple biological children naturally .
i think traumatised is more fitting than " sexual abused " - since - as i understood it - you were passively not actively involved in your dads actions .
stalin authorised the sale of something like 2,000 tanks and 3,000 aircraft to china during the korean war .
 in another display of her amazing skills , hitomi is here to fulfil all of her customers ' needs .

you can miss them on disc one but quina joins permanently at a later point .

they rarely listen to me about this , come here with cash just to realise that they ca nt use it in many places , and then have to bring all their cash home again .
i love hitting them with “ ok zoomer ” after they use “ ok boomer ” - always leads to a laugh on server disc
shurican ( you only have one from the sound of it ) are n't deadly yes you can poison them with shit or whatever but against zombies that would n't do much and it does n't effect humans that fast , plus they most likely have a medkit or clean water and you can mostly likely not hit the throat i doubt your aim is that good and may i add that you are a fucking weeb and do n't you have an axe or a hammer laying around ?
it takes about 8 seconds for a gauge to charge up .
5 min \ 60 seconds = 300 seconds 300 seconds \ 8 % = 24 seconds you can save using newbie mona 's leader 24 seconds / 8 seconds per tap skill = 3 extra tap skills the 8 % gauge on all your other child does n't matter because their buff should last long enough where you can apply them again . &
as long as the 15 % applies on 2 or more attack it already out - weights the 8 % gauge .
i live in a safe labour seat and i 'm voting green because nothing comes even close to the importance of the environment now , not even brexit .
open up a shop in your neighbourhood that says “ xyz real estate : buy / rent properties ” .

we produce stuff that we do n't need ( or there s a better alternative than it or maybe it really is useless like 6 pack electricity , which is a scam item ) , buy them for absolute no reason at all(because we unfortunely programme ourself to be consumed unnecessary amount ) , or not doing to prevent it at all because it 's much easier and we spend less cents for it .
looks like a really stock - standard bolt - action , and it 's one of the few guns where i 'd argue i 'm honestly a bigger fan of those tacticool polymer stocks like the archangel aesthetics - wise over wood .
if you ’re american , my understanding is there ’s a massive labour shortage in the trade nationwide and you can get a job anywhere if you seem like a worker .
they 're good enough to be souped in with armies that are not shabby with their anti - armour as it is .

those distributors want to maximise the money they make from their movies so they schedule releases that they think will increase their chances of success not just individually , but for the entire slate .

if your girlfriend has paid any bills owed to verizon then y' all should be fine , last i know porting a number out is n't a criminal offence
labour has been portraying a narrative that the uk is in a crisis situation with respect to critical public services and homelessness and the like .
it gives the impression that either a ) the problems are n't as big as labour portrays , which is why they can move on to more " positive " spending projects quickly or b ) labour are n't prioritising the problems enough ... which is a weird impression to get from labour of all parties .

i agree drugs could be controlled and made better like alcohol but current drugs are too dangerous ( heroine and crack for example ) to be legalised
it just takes a while for a kids sense of humour to become original , or at the very least mature beyond drawing a swastika and saying the same ' edgy ' shit talk they heard some other kid say . &
under labour we would all have to pay even more to subsidise the tiny amount of people who use the train to commute , mostly in london , as if we have spent enough on transport in london .
i saw something libellous and did n't censor it or remove it , i simply unstickied it , and sent a message i did n't have to to the op to explain .
do n't spend your points on much more than developing tech right now , eventually take exploration ideas ( it 's in the middle of the idea groups i think ) and colonise the islands by africa .
even if that game ends up not being great , it 's enjoyable for me personally to understand why a game is bad instead of just casting judgement based on half a game .
they have university degrees but are taking manual labour jobs ( mainly because of imperfect english ) .
they can either break boards with recurring gyzarus 's effect multiple times or set up tonnes of negates with heraklinos and domitianus
cringe dialogue and character assassinations across the board .
i hear lake city quiet pills are pretty effective for this kind of behaviour .
but its dialogue and characterization left a lot to be desired .

he needs to accept that no amount of magical wishes are going to erase the damage that her behaviour has caused .
you would n't accept this behaviour from anyone else , and you have too much self - respect to allow yourself to be treated this badly .
what 's frustrating and confusing the heck out of everyone is that the lore is practically non - existent , and what little bits do exist ( exclusively lich dialogue ) directly contradict the gameplay .
the peace between countries exists , but no country exists without daily violent behaviour from individuals or groups within that country .

mike is my favourite ' natty ' bodybuilder !
that thing weighed a tonne .

if you 're neither left nor right and constantly in the centre , it would probably mean you had no opinions at all , and i have n't met many centrists who believe nothing .
i 'm pro - choice and an advocate for marriage equality but at the same time , i do n't support the legalisation of marijuana .
and since all these varying views make it hard for me to describe myself in a single word , i just say centrist because if my views were all summed up , it 'll probably be closest to the centre ... even though independent would be a more accurate word ( its just that calling yourself independent tells the other person nothing about any of your views , other than the fact that you 're not an ideologue ) ...
that 's simply a disguised appeal to authority , an appeal to " is it respectable , is it credible , do the mandarin establishment authorise it " .
